            <h5>Stephen Jarrett</h5>
            <p>Stephen is a former industrial engineer turned software developer. He has previous experience in the consumer packaged goods industry with a focus on supply chain and operations. Originally from Tennessee, he relocated to Atlanta, GA in 2015. A love for technology and computers led him to a career switch by way of DigitalCrafts' 16-week full-stack development bootcamp. Stephen enjoys learning new technologies and creating solutions to real problems. As a University of Tennessee graduate, he's passionate about college sports (especially the SEC) and is big into video games. RepSearch was a great opportunity to develop a tool that is informative and useful. It provided great practice with: responsive web pages using CSS, jQuery and working with RESTful APIs. Future improvements Stephen would like to add would be autocompleting cities and states utilizing Google's places API as well as additional CSS animations.</p>
            <h5>Joshua Owens</h5>
            <p>Joshua has a diverse professional background, with experience in foodservice, publishing, distribution logistics, events planning, international relations, nonprofits, and youth mentorship. Feel free to check out his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jko113/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> for a more comprehensive summary. After more than two years in tech support at an Atlanta software company, in April 2018 Joshua formally transitioned into the world of software development, embarking on a 16-week full-stack immersive course at <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/" target="_blank">DigitalCrafts</a> in Buckhead. The applied, hands-on knowledge gained from the intensive program supplements his academic studies in computer science at Kennesaw State University, from which he holds a graduate certificate in software engineering foundations. In his free time, Joshua enjoys learning foreign languages, watching films, jogging and hiking, eating good food, and hanging out with his kind wife and their crazy kitty.</p>
